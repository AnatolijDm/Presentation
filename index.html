					<h1>Electron</h1>

				<section>
					<h2>What is Electron?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Electron is an open source project supported by GitHub and the community. </li>
						<li>Electron is a library that you can use to write desktop applications using html / css / javascript.</li>
						<li>These applications can be packaged under Windows / Mac / Linux and delivered via Windows / Mac-stores.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where Electron was used?</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>There are created a lot of programs based of Electron, such as: </p>
						<li>A text editor Atom</li>
						<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
						<li> Mancy REPL console for Node.js</li>
						<li>Meteor.js frameworks</li>
						<li>the Slack chat client application</li>
						<li>Skype</li>
						<li>Discord</li>
						<li>the WordPress desktop client</li>
						<li>...</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why desktop apps are useful to create?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Possibility to work with materials offline</li>
						<li>Possibility to interact with the file system</li>
						<li>Possibility to connect printers, USB devices</li>
						<li>Using desktop applications is more familiar to users.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Have the using Electron some limitations?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It will not build when used an older operating systems (less than Win7 / MacOS 10.9 / Ubuntu 12.04).</li>
						<li>You should not write browsers and programs that use a lot of native things</li>
						<li>If the disk space is limited</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What does Electron consist of?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Electron integrates Chromium to work with UI</li>
						<li>Node.js for working with the file system and network</li>
						<li>A set of native modules for working with the operating system</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
					<h2>Electron consists of two types of processes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Main</li>
						<li>Renderer</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These processes run in parallel.<br>
							The memory and process resources are isolated from each other.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						Main is a Node-like process. 
						It is responsible for the application life cycle (opening and closing it)
						for integration with the OS, and responsible for creating Renderer processes.
				</section>
				<section>
						Renderer process - it is the browser window in your application (your UI)<br>
						There can be several of these processes - and they are completely independent
				</section>
			</section>
				<section>
					<img src="./images/Processes.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					The Electron application processes' behavior are like browser<br>
					First, the browser starts and then the tab opens.<br>
					Each tab is like one Renderer process in Electron.<br>
					But if you close all the tabs, then your chrome remains running and you can still open or close the tabs or completely close the browser
				</section>
				<section>
					Since the processes are completely isolated from each other and are responsible for various tasks, for interaction they use IPC.<br>
					IPC is an inter process communication module that is needed for communication between processes:<br>
					IPC is an instance of the Event Emmiter class. It provides several methods so you can send and subscribe to messages from Renderer / Main processes.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>So, let's create the first program using Electron!</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					First, type: "npm init -y" in terminal to create dependencies<br>
					Then, type: "npm install electron --save-dev" to install Electron app<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					Let's create index.js file and type the code to create program window. (it wll do the main process)
					<img src="./images/js.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					We have already connect the html file with index.js, so now we need to create html file.
					<img src="./images/html.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					In package.json name command for running program
					<img src="./images/json.png">
				</section>				
				<section>
					So, now we can start the first program created by Electron<br>
					Just type in terminal command: "npm run start"
					<img src="./images/electron1.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					We can create css file and make connection with html file the same way as in all web projects.
					<img src="./images/electron+css.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					The Electron is based by Chrome and we can see it then we open DevTools in our program. We can do it by code in index.js file.
					<img src="./images/js+dev.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="./images/electron+css+devTools.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					We can create the other js file (it will do the renderer process) and connect it with html by typing in script tag: "require('./other-script.js')"<br>
					These js files we can create a lot. We using this other js file the same way as in all web projects.
				</section>
				<section>
					Finally, we created the simple electron program.<br>
					As you can see it is only the basic method.<br>
					For more deep study of Electron you can browse Electron courses.
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						The positive side of Electron:
						<li>Work with the Web: HTML, CSS, JS - Web as UI</li>
						<li>Chrome only. Chrome Devtools *</li>
						<li>Development speed</li>
						<li>Latest browser features</li>
						<li>Is free!</li>
						<li>Does not require knowledge of C ++, Swift</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						The negative side of Electron:
						<li>Node + Chrome require. Project Weight (100mb)</li>
						<li>Even a simple Hello World will weigh a lot</li>
						<li>Rendering processes create threads (eat all the memory)</li>
						<li>Autoupdater for Linux platform</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						The conclusion:
						<li>You don't need to know C++ language to create Desktop apps</li>
						<li>If you can create sites, you can create a native desktop application, using Electron.</li>
						<li>Electron is ideal for creating MVP</li>
					</ul>
